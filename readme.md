Lohud node networks
==============

Lohud's initial node network interactive for linking the lower hudson valley to notable celebrities from/in the area and their notable works. 

Test version as of now: http://data.lohud.com/kaitest/021815mamaroneck/

Project code
==============

Tried various javascript library for this including D3.js, vivagraph.js and vis.js before settling on cytograph.js (not to be confused with Cytograph software).

Running Foundation 5 alongside it.

To-do
==============

* Cleanup and optimize code - heavy load on the page, CSS could do with additional cleaning
* ~~Figure out the numerous errors showing up in the inspector~~
* Move more into the mamaroneck JSON and template it for scalability
