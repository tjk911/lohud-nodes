      <p>The Lower Hudson Valley is getting plenty of love at this year's Oscars. Rye's Chance Kelly gives orders to Bradley Cooper in "American Sniper," Rockland's Bill Murray provides a star turn in the Wes Anderson's "The Grand Budapest Hotel" and Dobbs Ferry students in The Marching Cobras of New York provided the soundtrack to Michael Keaton's underwear-clad stroll through Times Square in "Birdman."</p> 

      <p>But there's two other nominees with local connections. Bennett Miller and Dan Futterman got nods for writing and directing "Foxcatcher," respectively. The filmmaking duo graduated from Mamaroneck High School in 1985, but they're far from the only MHS grads in Hollywood.</p> 

      <p>"We didn't teach the PACE program to necessarily make these kids go into the arts professionally," says John Fredrickson, who taught theater for the school's Performing Arts Curriculum Experience program for 27 years. "But I've got to tell you, I'm incredibly proud."</p> 

      <p>There might be something in the water, because, since 2005, Mamaroneck alum have been nominated for nine Academy Awards - in the writing and directing categories alone - though they didn't take any statues home.</p>

            <p>Back in 1997, he won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast for "The Birdcage." </p>
            <p>His first Oscar nod came for 2005's "Capote." Futterman was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, but that award went to "Brokeback Mountain." </p>
            <p>This year, Futterman is nominated along with E. Max for writing "Foxcatcher."</p>

                  There was once a chance you'd be looking at two lohud Oscar winners in this scene from 2007's "A Mighty Heart." In 2013 it was reported Angelina Jolie was looking to buy the 11-acre Petra Island in Lake Mahopac. The deal never came through, but she has other local connections: Jolie's father, Jon Voight, was born and raised in Yonkers. In "A Mighty Heart," Futterman plays Daniel Pearl, an American reporter who was captured and killed by terrorists in 2002.

                  Graduates of the class of ‘85, Bennett Miller and Dan Futterman's first major collaboration was on the 2005 film "Capote." Miller and Futterman first met Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who plays Truman Capote in the film, as teenagers at a summer drama camp and Hoffman would go on to win Best Actor for his performance. Miller was nominated for best director, but didn‘t win. The statue did come to Westchester, though, since New Rochelle's Ang Lee took home the prize for "Brokeback Mountain."

This was the second time Miller collaborated with Philip Seymour Hoffman, who played Art Howe, manager of the Oakland A's in the film.

            <p>For his two follow-up films, 2013's "Silver Linings Playbook" and 2014's "American Hustle," Russell was nominated for both writing and directing.</p>

                  Recruiting the help of past collaborators Bradley Cooper, Christian Bale, Jennifer Lawrence, Amy Adams, Robert De Niro and more, David O Russell gave us 2013's "American Hustle." Russell seems to have found a winning combination, considering the film was nominated for a total of ten Academy Awards, including Russell's third directing nod and his second writing nomination. The film was also up for Best Picture, which went to "12 Years a Slave."

                  Earning David O. Russell his second directing nomination and first writing nod was 2012's "Silver Linings Playbook." Seemingly half the cast was up for an acting Oscar, including Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver and Jennifer Lawrence, with Lawrence being the only winner. Proving winning an Oscar can be a dangerous gig, Lawrence famously tripped on her dress and fell flat as she was heading to the stage to accept her award.

                  Considering how often he casts the same actors, David O' Russell seems to be a good friend to have if you're looking for screen work. 2010's "The Fighter" was the third time Russell worked with Mark Wahlberg (right), following "Three Kings" in 1999 and 2004's "I Heart Huckabees." Russell would direct Christian Bale again in "American Hustle." "The Fighter" earned a Best Director nod for Russell, but the award went to Tom Hooper for "The King's Speech."

                  Despite his character's name being Bunny, Dillon was far from soft and cuddly in Oliver Stone's "Platoon." His character shows a lust for violence, savagely beating a Viatnamese villager to death in one of the films more disturbing scenes. The 1987 film was nominated for eight Academy Awards, bringing home four, including Best Picture and Best Director.

                  Proving he also has comedy chops, Matt Dillon starred as an obsessed private investigator in the 1998 comedy hit "There's Something About Mary." If he seems especially convincing lusting after Cameron Diaz's title character in the film, that's because the two were dating in real life during filming, but broke up after production wrapped. Somewhat unsurprisingly, "There's Something About Mary" wasn't up for any Oscars, but it was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical.

      <p><b>Director</b>: Paul Haggis</p>
      <p>Matt Dillon's only Oscar nod came for his role as John Ryan, a racist police officer working in a diverse L.A. neighborhood, in the 2004 film "Crash." </p>
      <p>The film boasts other Oscar darlings, including Sandra Bullock, who won Best Actress for "The Blind Side" and was nominated for "Gravity" and Don Cheadle, who was up for Best Actor for 2005's "Hotel Rwanda." </p>
      <p>While Dillon lost out to George Clooney, "Crash" still brought home the awards for Best Film, Best Original Screenplay and Best Achievement in Editing.</p>

      <p>Dillon will be reprising his role as the dim-witted, hot-tempered Johnny "Drama" Chase when HBO releases the "Entourage" movie, which reunites the crew after a four year hiatus. </p>
      <p>Having played the character for eight seasons, Dillon will surely be screaming "Victory!" when the film releases in June.</p>

      <p>Steve Carell stars as convicted murder John DuPont, and while the actor is typically seen in comedic roles, he said in an interview with Variety that, "to work with Bennett was an enormous draw.

      <p>Proving he also has comedy chops, Matt Dillon starred as an obsessed private investigator in the 1998 comedy hit "There's Something About Mary." </p>
      <p>If he seems especially convincing lusting after Cameron Diaz's title character in the film, that's because the two were dating in real life during filming, but broke up after production wrapped. </p>
      <p>Somewhat unsurprisingly, "There's Something About Mary" wasn't up for any Oscars, but it was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical.</p>
