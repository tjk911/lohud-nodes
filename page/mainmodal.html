      <p>The Lower Hudson Valley is getting plenty of love at this year's Oscars. Rye's Chance Kelly gives orders to Bradley Cooper in "American Sniper," Rockland's Bill Murray provides a star turn in the Wes Anderson's "The Grand Budapest Hotel" and Dobbs Ferry students in The Marching Cobras of New York provided the soundtrack to Michael Keaton's underwear-clad stroll through Times Square in "Birdman."</p> 

      <p>But there's two other nominees with local connections. Bennett Miller and Dan Futterman got nods for writing and directing "Foxcatcher," respectively. The filmmaking duo graduated from Mamaroneck High School in 1985, but they're far from the only MHS grads in Hollywood.</p> 

      <p>"We didn't teach the PACE program to necessarily make these kids go into the arts professionally," says John Fredrickson, who taught theater for the school's Performing Arts Curriculum Experience program for 27 years. "But I've got to tell you, I'm incredibly proud."</p> 

      <p>There might be something in the water, because, since 2005, Mamaroneck alum have been nominated for nine Academy Awards - in the writing and directing categories alone - though they didn't take any statues home.</p>

        <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers.

We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.</p>

      <p>Futterman had only done three films before being cast in the Mike Nichols-directed film. Following Nichols' November 2014 death, Futterman told "The Hollywood Reporter" that the "Graduate" director would often have to monitor Williams' scenes from another room because he couldn't contain his giggling.</p>

      <p><b>Director</b>: David O. Russell</p>
      <p>Recruiting the help of past collaborators Bradley Cooper, Christian Bale, Jennifer Lawrence, Amy Adams, Robert De Niro and more, David O Russell gave us 2013's "American Hustle."</p> 
      <p>Russell seems to have found a winning combination, considering the film was nominated for a total of ten Academy Awards, including Russell's third directing nod and his second writing nomination. The film was also up for Best Picture, which went to "12 Years a Slave."</p>

      <p>O'Keefe wasn't alone, though, Duvall got a Best Acting nomination for his turn as an aggressive marine pilot.</p>

      <p>After the success of "Moneyball," Miller followed it up with another true life sports story with "Foxcatcher," written by Dan Futterman and E. Max Frye. </p>
      <p>Steve Carell stars as convicted murder John DuPont, and while the actor is typically seen in comedic roles, he said in an interview with Variety that, "to work with Bennett was an enormous draw. The script was excellent and intriguing and sad and absurdly funny in places and very dark."</p>

      <p>Dillon's breakout role came as Dallas Winston in Francis Ford Coppola's 1983 film, "The Outsiders." </p>
      <p>Helping to spark the Brat Pack craze of the '80s, the film also starred Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe and Ralph Macchio. </p>
      <p>On Coppola's days off from filming, he reportedly spent his time adapting the script to "Rumble Fish," which came out later that same year and also starred Dillon.</p>

      <p>Proving he also has comedy chops, Matt Dillon starred as an obsessed private investigator in the 1998 comedy hit "There's Something About Mary." </p>
      <p>If he seems especially convincing lusting after Cameron Diaz's title character in the film, that's because the two were dating in real life during filming, but broke up after production wrapped. </p>
      <p>Somewhat unsurprisingly, "There's Something About Mary" wasn't up for any Oscars, but it was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical.</p>

      <p>His character shows a lust for violence, savagely beating a Vietnamese villager to death in one of the films more disturbing scenes. </p>
      <p>The 1987 film was nominated for eight Academy Awards, bringing home four, including Best Picture and Best Director.</p>

      <p>Miller was nominated for best director, but didn't win. The statue did come to Westchester, though, since New Rochelle's Ang Lee took home the prize for "Brokeback Mountain."</p>
